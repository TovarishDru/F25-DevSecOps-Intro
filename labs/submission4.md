## Package Type Distribution

**Syft:**

    npm: 1128
    deb (OS): 10
    binary: 1

**Trivy:**

    Node.js: 1125
    OS (Debian): 10

**Conclusion:**

Both tools agree on OS packages. However, Syft finds 3 more Node.js packages (1128 vs 1125) and also detects 1 binary artifact that Trivy doesn’t mention in its package list. It is fair to say that they had done equally good

## Dependency Discovery Analysis

**Coverage:**

Syft has slightly broader inventory: 1139 artifacts total (1128 npm + 10 deb + 1 binary) vs Trivy’s 1135 (1125 Node.js + 10 OS).
Syft includes a “binary” artifact type, while Trivy doesn’t list binaries

**Structure and context:**

Trivy groups results by Target and Class (os-pkgs vs lang-pkgs), making it easier to see which layer a package came from.
Syft gives rich artifact types and tends to enumerate more file-level information

**Conclusion:**

If the priority is a broader inventory Syft edges out Trivy.
If you want clearer operational context Trivy presents the data more cleanly.
Other information detection delta is negligable

## License Discovery Analysis

Syft surfaces slightly more Node.js license entries and more varied/non-standard identifiers (good for discovering odd/ad-hoc licenses). It also provies more detailed license data.
On the other hand, Trivy’s per-class breakdown is cleaner for automated policy checks and compliance reporting

## SCA Tool Comparison

**Grype:**

    Critical: 8
    High: 21
    Medium: 23
    Low: 1
    Negligible: 12

**Trivy:**

    Critical: 8
    High: 23
    Medium: 23
    Low: 16

**Conclusion:**

Both tools found 8 Critical vulnerabilities, but Trivy detected more Low and High vulnerabilities, while Grype reported 12 of Negligible issues

## Critical Vulnerabilities Analysis

Both tools found similar threats, so we may surely list top 5 of them

**Top 5 Critical vulnerabilities detected:**

1. CVE-2023-46233
   Weak PBKDF2 implementation, 1.3M times weaker than the current standard.

2. CVE-2015-9235
   Verification bypass with altered token.

3. CVE-2015-9235
   Verification bypass with altered token (variant).

4. CVE-2019-10744
   Prototype pollution in defaultsDeep function.

5. GHSA-5mrr-rgp6-x4gr
   Command injection vulnerability.

**Remediations:**

    Upgrade affected packages to latest secure versions.

    Replace unsupported libraries with maintained alternatives

    Implement dependency management

    Use parametrized expressions to avoid injections

### License Compliance Assessment

Syft and Trivy found mostly similar licences, so the licencse compliance is common for them. There is only one real issue: GPL/LGPL licenses may pose compliance risks in proprietary projects.

**Recommendations:**

    Avoid dependencies under GPL/LGPL

    Establish a license policy integrated into CI/CD to be surely secure

## Additional Security Features

**Summary of findings:**

    High: 2 (AsymmetricPrivateKey)
    Medium: 2 (JWT tokens)

**Risk assessment:**

Private key in image (High): attackers can mint valid JWTs or otherwise abuse cryptography.
JWT tokens in tests (Medium): lower risk, but should never ship in the runtime image.

## Accuracy Analysis

    Common packages: 1126
    Syft-only: 13
    Trivy-only: 9
    Union (total unique across both): 1148

**Overlap metrics:**

    Common/union: 1126/1148 ≈ 98.1%
    Symmetric difference: 22 packages (1.9% of union)

We observe a very high agreement on package inventory (≈98%). The small delta likely comes from Syft surfacing an extra binary artifact and a few additional Node.js packages, while Trivy may deduplicate or ignore certain dev/optional deps

## Tool Strengths and Weaknesses

    Syft+Grype: detailed SBOMs, precise dependency mapping and vulnerability scanning, requires multiple steps, very slow at runtime

    Trivy: single and quick scan, slightly less good at package detection

## Use Case Recommendations

    Syft+Grype: detailed analysis of dependency and licenses

    Trivy: quick scanning in CI/CD pipelines

## Integration Considerations

    CI/CD: trivy integrates easily, Syft+Grype requires multiple steps and may fail due to timeouts

    Automation: both are suitable for continuous monitoring, but Syft+Grype provides deeper analysis for compliance
